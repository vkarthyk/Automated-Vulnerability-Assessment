# AUTOMATED VULNERABILITY SCANNER

## Both the scripts have been written in BASH and require Kali Linux to run. All tools used are already included in Kali Linux 2.0.

There are 2 bash scripts:

1) ** vuln_assess.sh**

2) **domain_recon.sh**

1) **vuln_assess.sh** can be used to conduct internal IT security audits. It takes in the IP range of the network to be scanned. It prompts the user if he/she wishes to exclude any of the IPs from the given range. We conduct a ping sweep using NMap and detect all the systems that respond to our request. The output shows all the hosts that are ‘Up’ and running along with their subdomain name. The user can now choose any of the IPs that are displayed to scan and detect the open ports and services running. This is also done using Nmap. All the outputs are saved in files for the user to refer later. 

Based on the open ports and services running, specific tools are used to automatically test the identified service for any vulnerabilities. We create a new workspace for that IP and import the scan done earlier to Metasploit so that the portscan can be imported to the database running and we do not need to repeat the process every time. The folder "resource" contains the Metasploit resource scripts I wrote to scan the particular services running on the ports.

to run type: bash vuln_assess.sh

-> Enter the name you want to give to the scan
-> Enter the IP range you want to scan
-> Enter any IPs you wish to exclude
-> Choose from the list of identified hosts

2) **domain_recon.sh** can be used to conduct VAPT for a customer. The script takes in a domain name and extracts all useful information about the domain. The script uses NSLOOKUP to get the nameservers associated with the domains. It then attempts to perform zone transfers from the obtained SOA records and nameservers. If a zone transfer is successful, then we can obtain many valuable information like the internal domains associated with that domain including any admin subdomains. Then using tools like DirBuster we can attempt to extract the directories stored in the subdomain. 

Tools like Dmitry and theHarvester collect legal information about the domain as well as the email addresses and names. They crawl websites like Netcraft, Google, LinkedIn to obtain these sensitive information. The obtained list of names and emails can be used to brute-force into further servers like Email or employee portals. Then using a tool called CeWL we can create custom word list by extracting all the important terms from the website which can be used as dictionary to brute-force passwords. It spiders the website and looks for all the important terms and gives us a dictionary. Quite often, companies tend to use passwords related to their company and chances are that one of the terms on the website is the actual password for any admin account.

to run type: bash domain_recon.sh
